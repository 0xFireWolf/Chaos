# Chaos

A control center for CMake + Conan + C++20 projects.

## Dependencies

Chaos is written in Python 3 and requires the following packages:
- distro: `pip install distro`
- requests: `pip install requests`

to install packages globally, in case `pip` does not allow it (e.g., on Ubuntu), install them via `apt`:
```bash
sudo apt install python3-distro python3-requests
```
